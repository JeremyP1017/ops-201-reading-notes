How to Use System Restore in Windows.
In my opinion the system restore function in Windows is incredibly important because it allows you to go back to a previously saved location
if something goes wrong or your files get corrupted. This concept makes sense because I've used a variation of it in the past not in terms of
tech but when I was a rotary punch operator when I was loading my program into the machine if there was a section of material that wasn't supposed
to be punched I was able to turn off the punch or the turret at any point to prevent the machine from damaging the material.
