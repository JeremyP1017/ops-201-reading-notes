VeeamZIP delivers technology that lets you create backups of running VMs. With VeeamZIP, you have to specify only two things – the VM you
want to backup and where your resulting backup file will go. It’s that easy! The backup will be deduplicated (within the single VM being backed up) and 
compressed, resulting in significantly lower backup storage requirements.

The ability to make backups for your virtual machines is incredibly important because at any given point if you're running a new code or trying to 
automate certain tasks if something fails it could corrupt your VM so every so often having the ability to back up the current state of your VM in 
the event of some catastrophic failure is always going to be much better than starting from scratch.
