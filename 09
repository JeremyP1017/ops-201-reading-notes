A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a procedure that is specific to your company or organization
that describes the activities necessary to complete a particular task.

SOPs are a primary way to implement or enforce a policy. Policies are intended to steer an organization 
to achieve the mission, vision, and goals of an organization, but without SOPs, are not actionable. SOPs also
encourage consistency in execution, which is critical for demonstrating compliance with or achievement of targets
described in a service level agreement.

In my experience sops are extremely important because it gives the employee a clear outline of the task and
how to accomplish the task and in my experience it's also given the employee fixes for errors that have come
up during standard operation so I think having a clear outline of how something needs to be done streamlines 
the process and minimizes user error.
